# Progress

One entry per milestone (newest last). Each entry: what works, the exact commands that
proved it on the box with their results, evidence paths (docs/evidence/README.md rules),
and what is left. Keep it factual; numbers come from runs, not estimates.

## M0 — Recon and scaffold (2026-10-06)

- Works: hfbox measured and documented (RX 9070 XT 16 GB, ROCm 7.2, torch 2.14; rsync laptop↔box 1.4–1.9 MB/s; YOLO11n 8.1 ms/frame, YOLO11m 10.7 ms/frame) in docs/compute.md. `services/worker` stage DAG over a content-hash cache wraps courtcam's nine stages with byte-identical output. Ten providers selectable local/aws with AWS stubs. CDK skeleton synthesizes without credentials; CI workflow; `make sync|test|demo`.
- Verified on hfbox: `scripts/box-test.sh` on HEAD + platform changes → ruff clean, courtcam 99, api 108, worker 10 passed, `cdk synth` ok, web tsc/eslint clean, Playwright chromium+live 62 passed. `make demo` → 9 misses then 9 hits. Kennesaw 240 s through the worker: 76.4 s cold (3.1× realtime), 1.4 s warm.
- Evidence: docs/evidence/M2/worker-cache-synthetic.txt · docs/perf.md
- Decisions: D-34 worker + cache, D-35 provider layout, D-36 courtcam subtree split.
- Left / known issues: no real fan-out stage yet (first ones arrive with per-play / per-angle work); Step Functions machine is a placeholder chain; local tts/llm/embeddings/face/speaker raise NotConfiguredError until models land.

## M3 — Fire TV client (2026-10-06)

- Works: `apps/tv` (react-native-tvos 0.87 + react-native-video) at parity with the browser TV route: Library; Watch with seek-bar event markers, select mode with D-pad cone focus and overlap cycling, transform-based follow, spotlight, court inset, tag/rename, bookmarks; Highlights reel; Review; Pair. Shared logic in `packages/tv-core`, used by apps/web and apps/tv.
- Verified on hfbox: apps/tv `tsc` + `eslint` clean, `playwright test --project=tv` 11 passed; apps/web `tsc` + `eslint` clean, Playwright chromium+live 62 passed. Gradle `assembleDebug` + `assembleRelease` → arm64/armv7 APKs (leanback launcher, targetSdk 36), box-only at /workspace/wt/replay-tv-scratch/apk/.
- Evidence: docs/evidence/M3/tv-synthetic/01..09.png (synthetic game) · docs/evidence/local/M3/tv-real-kennesaw/ (real footage, not committed)
- Decisions: D-37.
- Left / known issues: never run on a device or emulator (no KVM, no Fire TV attached) — playback, key codes and performance on Fire OS unverified; API base hardcoded in apps/tv/app.json; release signed with the debug keystore; Highlights reel plays wide only.
